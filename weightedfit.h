/* ---------------------------
 WeightedFit Experiment Class
 ------------------------------
 Description:
 * Derived class of AbstractExperiment. This is designed for experiments that are expected to find a constant value and thus calculate the weighted mean and standard deviation (SD).
 * Contains a nested statistics struct to hold all the accumulated measurement statistics.
 Member Variables:
 * private  weightstatistics (Weighted Statistics) structure which contains:
 - Stores all the constants used to find the the wieghted mean and SD as a single variable.
 - invSqrErr (inverse square of the combined error/measurement error), yInvSqrErr (measurement over the inverse square of the combined/measurement error).
 Functionality:
 * Private member function (only WeightedFit can access):
 - Accumulate the weightstatistics of the WeightedFit classes resultset.
 - The '+' operator has been overloaded such that the weightStatistics accummulates Measumrements M that are added to it.
 - Calculate the Weighted mean and SD for the resultset and return WeightStatistics.
 * Public Memebr function:
 - produce a fit to the data and apply the private member functions and structs.
